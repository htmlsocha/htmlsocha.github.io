<section id="one"> <h1> Back Weathers </h1> </section> 
<section id="two"> From May 10 to May 11, 1996, nine people died during an attempt to scale the world's tallest mountain in an event that is now referred to as the Mount Everest disaster. <br />
Writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer was one of the 34 people trying to ascend the frozen peak – and the large number of climbers is said to have been one of the factors behind the tragedy.  <br />
This high traffic led to delays, with the majority of those who reached the top doing so after the advised turnaround time. <br />
Unusual weather conditions are believed to have sent oxygen levels plummeting by 14 percent, and a blizzard on Everest's southwest face also reduced visibility for the descending climbers, several of whom got lost and disoriented in the worsening storm.  <br />
Between them, the mountaineers suffered exhaustion, hypothermia, frostbite and hypoxia. <br />
Beck Weathers, who was part of Krakauer's expedition, had been discovered by a team member badly frostbitten and unable to move or even properly respond.   <br />
Yet after being left for dead, and despite serious hypothermia, Weathers somehow came to, walking under his own power to catch up the other survivors at Camp IV. After a storm, Weathers was again believed dead and nearly abandoned, but he was found to be conscious by Krakauer.
 In spite of his deteriorating condition, Weathers managed to make it down the mountain. <br />
  Frostbite claimed his nose, one hand, and five digits, but he recovered.Following his own experience of the grueling ordeal, Krakauer has said he feels remorse for the others who died, and he wrote the bestselling book Into Thin Air as what he has described as "an act of catharsis." 
  Krakauer added, "I thought that writing the book might purge Everest from my life. It hasn't, of course." <br /></section> 
  
  
  
  <section id="three"> <h1> Chris Bonington and Doug Scott </h1> </section> 
<section id="four"> On July 13, 1977, Chris Bonington and Doug Scott became the first climbers to summit Baintha Brakk in Pakistan, a peak known as The Ogre.<br />
 However, the descent turned disastrous when Scott slipped while rappelling and broke both his legs. <br />
Bonington then also had an accident while coming down the mountain, breaking several ribs and later contracting suspected pneumonia. <br />
Both men were helped by their team members but still had to maintain mental control in the face of many setbacks and the pain of their injuries  <br />
Scott, who crawled for 12 whole days, said he persevered by focusing on "one feature at a time. A nub of rock, a pinnacle.<br /> 
 Get there and then think about the next bit. Because to think about the whole thing was a bit mind-boggling." The team eventually made it to base camp where rescuers came to their aid.<br />
 Although these experiences are incredibly intense and potentially traumatizing for the climbers, their families are likely to suffer too – and even in cases where there are no fatal accidents, partners and children must cope with having a husband and father who constantly puts his life at risk. <br />
 Bonington's wife Wendy has found a perspective on the situation that works for her. "Love to me is the whole plant. Once we put conditions on something, that is cutting off one branch of growth," she says.<br />
 "There are very often things about another person that you cannot understand, but to me that does not change whether you love them or not."<br />

  <section id="five"> <h1> Joe Simpson </h1> </section> 
<section id="six"> In 1985, Joe Simpson and climbing mate Simon Yates successfully scaled the west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, which up until then had not been ascended.  <br />
All seemed well until Simpson broke his leg during the descent, and because both men were traveling light, they felt they had no choice but to continue in darkness. <br />
Yates lowered Simpson down the mountain, but when the knot connecting the two men snagged, Yates made the decision to cut the rope, to save himself from being pulled off the face. <br />
This sent Simpson falling 150 feet into a crevasse – and yet he did not die. <br />
Left alone, Simpson was sure he was finished, but in what he assumed would be "a form of suicide," he took action by rappelling further into the deep crack in the ice and was able to exit via a ledge. <br />
  For the next three and a half days, Simpson crawled the agonizing five miles to base camp. <br />
  Simpson, like other survivors on this list, wrote about his traumatic experience, and his award-winning 1988 memoir Touching the Void was turned into a documentary film in 2003.  <br />
  While retelling such stories might bring up potentially distressing memories, Susan Pease Banitt, author of The Trauma Toolkit: Healing PTSD From the Inside Out, thinks that it could also have a beneficial effect.  <br />
  "Disclosure promotes physical health and well-being. It does not seem to matter whether the traumas are told in therapy, among friends, or in writing; what does make a difference is the telling," she says.</section>  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
